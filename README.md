### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![Erchi Zhang LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linked-in-informational)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erchi-zhang-0867041b8/) 
I am Erchi Zhang. I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Data Science program at New York University, and I am actively seeking 2024 summer internship opportunities in data science, software development engineering, machine learning, data analysis, or anything relevant. I am proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, R, SQL, HTML/CSS and Shell script. During my undergraduate studies, I have coauthored two data science research papers, one is about [using Graph adaption BERT to detect malicious behaviors on Twitter](https://chunhuizng.github.io/data/GraphBERT-%20Bridging%20Graph%20and%20Text%20for%20Malicious%20Behavi
or%20Detection%20on%20Social%20Media-ICDM22.pdf) and another one is about [assisting any GNNs to distinguishable representations without unbiased attributes](https://chunhuizng.github.io/data/WWW23_GFAME_cameraready.pdf). In my GitHub repositories I mainly post my projects completed during my graduate studies.
