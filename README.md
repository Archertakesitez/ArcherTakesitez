### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
[![Erchi Zhang LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linked-in-informational)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erchi-zhang-0867041b8/)<br>
I am Erchi Zhang. I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Data Science program at New York University, and I am actively seeking 2024 summer internship opportunities in data science, software development engineering, machine learning, data analysis, or any relevant field. I am proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, R, SQL, HTML/CSS and Shell script. During my undergraduate studies, I have coauthored two data science research papers, one is about [using Graph adaption BERT to detect malicious behaviors on Twitter](https://chunhuizng.github.io/data/GraphBERT-%20Bridging%20Graph%20and%20Text%20for%20Malicious%20Behavior%20Detection%20on%20Social%20Media-ICDM22.pdf) and another one is about [assisting any GNNs to distinguishable representations without unbiased attributes](https://chunhuizng.github.io/data/WWW23_GFAME_cameraready.pdf). In my GitHub repositories I mainly post my projects completed during my graduate studies:
- [Billionaire Data Analysis](https://github.com/Archertakesitez/1007_project_goodgoodstudy), in which I have collaborated with my teammates to conduct a comprehensive data analysis via Python on a [Billionaires Statistics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset/data) from Kaggle.
- [Spotify Songs Data Analysis](https://github.com/Archertakesitez/capstone_project_1001), in which I have collaborated with my teammates to perform Data Analysis on a Spotify songs dataset; we have applied various techniques including multiple linear regression, lasso/ridge regression, significance tests, PCA, K-means clustering, logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest, MLP neural network, recommendation system, and so forth, to solve each of the given questions.
- [Data Visualizations](https://github.com/Archertakesitez/D3js_repository), in which I have applied D3.js, NotebookJS, and some Python tools to plot static as well as dynamic graphs for visualizations in Machine Learning.
